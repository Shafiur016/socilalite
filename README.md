This repository documents the **Depression_New_Submit (5)** experimental outline for dual NLP tasks on social-media text. For full details on goals, datasets, models, ensemble design, evaluation, and explainability, see [docs/EXPERIMENTAL_OUTLINE.md](docs/EXPERIMENTAL_OUTLINE.md).

A project scaffold implementing the outlined workflow lives in [`depressor/`](depressor/). It includes configuration files, scripts, Python package modules, serving stubs, and placeholder tests to help organize future development.
